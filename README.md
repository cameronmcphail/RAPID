# RAPID - Robustness Analysis Producing Intelligent Decisions
The RAPID software package enables the generic guidance framework introduced in McPhail et al. (soon to be published) (see reference below) to be implemented in a user-friendly and consistent manner, including functionality to guide the user through the process of creating a custom robustness metric.
McPhail, C., Maier, H.R., Westra, S., van der Linden, L., Kwakkel, J.H. (to be published). Guidance framework and software for understanding and achieving system robustness.
